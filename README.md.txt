Hello everyone,

My name is Lazy, and I am an aspiring video game developer. I started my journey on July 3, 2024, and created this video game in just 4 days. I began with a 2D game to see if I would enjoy it, but I discovered that I prefer working with 3D video games. Now, I'm excited to try my hand at 3D development.

This project is open for anyone who wants to contribute, modify, or take it for themselves. Feel free to use and improve it as you wish.
